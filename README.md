This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Running as a Desktop App (Electron)

### Development

```
npm run electron:dev
```
This will start the Next.js app and open it in an Electron window.

### Production Build (macOS & Windows)

```
npm run electron:build
```
This will build the Next.js app, export it, and package it as a desktop app for your OS (macOS DMG/ZIP, Windows NSIS/ZIP) in the `dist/` folder.

If you want to build for a different OS, see [electron-builder docs](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build) for cross-compilation options.
